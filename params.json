{"name":"Recommendation System with Collaborative Filtering","tagline":"A recommender system prototype based on user-user collaborative filtering","body":"## Setup\r\n\r\nThe system is built with LensKit, an open-source took kit for building recommenders.\r\n\r\nRequires the following:\r\n\r\n[Java SE Development Kit 7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html/)\r\n\r\n[LensKit](http://lenskit.grouplens.org/)\r\n\r\n[Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)\r\n\r\nJava IDE such as [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) or [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nThis recommendation system prototype uses user-user collaborative filtering.  [Here for details.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering)\r\n\r\nThe algorithm is composed of the following steps.\r\n\r\n1. Compute user similarities by taking the cosine between the users’ mean-centered rating vectors (that is, subtract each user's mean rating from their rating vector, and compute the cosine between those two vectors). \r\n\r\n2. For each item’s score, use the 30 most similar users who have rated the item.\r\n\r\n3. Use mean-centering to normalize ratings for scoring by computing the weighted average of each neighbor’s offset from average and add the user’s average rating.\r\n\r\n## Test Drive\r\n\r\nA set of test data is provided for movie ratings, but can be easily adopted for other domains.\r\n\r\n\r\ndata/movie-titles.csv\r\nMaps Movie IDs to Movie Titles.\r\n\r\ndata/ratings.csv\r\nUsers and their movie ratings. Each line of the CSV file is ordered as: User ID, Movie ID, Rating\r\n\r\ndata/users.csv\r\nMaps User ID to User Name.\r\n\r\nThe test data is injected into the system in CBFMain.java in the method configureRecommender().\r\n\r\nRun the recommender with command similar to the following:\r\nrun-uu 1024:77 1024:268 1024:462 1024:393 1024:36955 2048:77 2048:36955 2048:788\r\n\r\nFor each pair, the first item is the User ID and the second pair is the Movie ID.\r\n\r\nOutputs associate score for each move/user pair.  With the test dataset, the following result is obtained.\r\n\r\n2048,788,3.8509,Mrs. Doubtfire (1993)\r\n2048,36955,3.9698,True Lies (1994)\r\n2048,77,4.8493,Memento (2000)\r\n1024,462,3.1082,Erin Brockovich (2000)\r\n1024,393,3.8722,Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004)\r\n1024,36955,2.3524,True Lies (1994)\r\n1024,77,4.3848,Memento (2000)\r\n1024,268,2.8646,Batman (1989)\r\n","google":"UA-40958814-6","note":"Don't delete this file!
